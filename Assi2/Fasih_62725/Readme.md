Lex is a computer program that generates lexical analyzers. 

Lex reads an input stream specifying the lexical analyzer and outputs source code implementing the lexer in the C programming language.

Issues were when we create two rules for mobile and email it conflicts with each other.
Then I created two different files for both of them.

The other major issue was the about of syntaxes of code and read/write file.
